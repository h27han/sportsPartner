What’s the common problem of a sports lover:
-    hard to find  enough people for team sports
-    Or simply find a guy with corresponding skill to play against
-    You might be thinking, there has to be an app that is doing that already. It’s 2016! But:
-    Existing similar apps either are not 
     - (etc meetup) specialized for sports - Some are simply too complicated
